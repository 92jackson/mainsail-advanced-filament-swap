[Guided M600 filament changes for Mainsail, with pop-ups]

This is my advanced pause script for Mainsail (poss compatible with Fluids??). It allows for guided pop-up alerts on run-out and M600 events, with a fluid UI suitable for all screen sizes

This script is based on the Jay Lexx's MOM script for for OctoPrint.
